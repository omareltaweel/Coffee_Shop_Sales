- **Build Reports:** Create interactive dashboards and reports using Power BI's visualization tools (charts, maps, etc.).
- **Apply DAX Measures:** Use DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create calculated columns and measures for more complex analyses.

## 7. Review and Iterate
- **Feedback Loop:** Present initial findings to stakeholders and gather feedback.
- **Refine Analysis:** Make necessary adjustments based on feedback, which may include modifying SQL queries, Excel analysis, or Power BI visuals.

## 8. Documentation
- **Document Processes:** Keep a record of all steps, including SQL queries, Excel formulas, and Power BI configurations for future reference.
- **Prepare a Report:** Summarize key findings, insights, and recommendations based on the analysis.

## 9. Presentation
